# ADR-001: QVF Platform Application Architecture

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2025-01-08  
**Architect**: Claude Code Architect Agent  
**Stakeholders**: QVF Development Team, Platform Users  

## Context

The QVF (Quantified Value Framework) system has evolved from a sophisticated Python library into a complete prioritization platform. The current structure has:

- Strong mathematical foundations (80% complete AHP engine)
- Comprehensive QVF criteria system
- Azure DevOps integration capabilities
- Basic admin UI components scattered across the codebase
- No clear separation between backend logic and frontend presentation

We need to architect a scalable, maintainable application that:
- Separates frontend and backend concerns
- Supports modern web application patterns
- Maintains existing QVF engine capabilities
- Enables future scalability and team collaboration
- Follows industry best practices for monorepo management

## Decision

We will restructure the QVF system as a **modern monorepo application** with clear separation of concerns and industry-standard architecture patterns.

### High-Level Architecture

```
qvf-platform/
├── apps/           # Applications (deployable services)
├── packages/       # Shared libraries and utilities  
├── services/       # Background/integration services
└── tools/          # Development and build tools
```

### Technology Stack Decisions

#### Backend Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI 0.100+ 
  - **Rationale**: Async support, automatic OpenAPI generation, high performance, Python ecosystem compatibility
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with SQLAlchemy 2.0 async ORM
  - **Rationale**: ACID compliance, JSONB support, excellent performance, mature tooling
- **Cache**: Redis 7+ 
  - **Rationale**: Session storage, job queuing, high-performance caching
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
  - **Rationale**: Stateless, scalable, industry standard
- **Validation**: Pydantic 2.0
  - **Rationale**: Type safety, automatic serialization, FastAPI integration

#### Frontend Stack  
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
  - **Rationale**: React 19 support, SSR/SSG capabilities, excellent developer experience, production-ready
- **Language**: TypeScript 5+
  - **Rationale**: Type safety, better IDE support, reduced runtime errors
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
  - **Rationale**: Utility-first CSS, rapid development, consistent design system
- **Components**: shadcn/ui + Custom QVF components
  - **Rationale**: Accessible, customizable, modern design patterns
- **State Management**: Zustand
  - **Rationale**: Lightweight, TypeScript-first, simpler than Redux
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query)
  - **Rationale**: Caching, synchronization, background updates, error handling

#### Development & Operations
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
  - **Rationale**: Faster installs, efficient disk usage, better workspace support
- **Monorepo Orchestration**: pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
  - **Rationale**: Efficient builds, dependency management, task parallelization
- **Type Safety**: OpenAPI TypeScript code generation
  - **Rationale**: End-to-end type safety, reduced API integration bugs

### Folder Structure Decision

#### Apps Directory (`/apps/`)
- **`/apps/api/`**: FastAPI backend application
  - Organized by domain (routers, services, models)
  - Clean architecture with dependency injection
  - Separate concerns (routing, business logic, data access)

- **`/apps/web/`**: Next.js frontend application  
  - App Router structure for file-based routing
  - Component organization by feature and shared UI
  - Type-safe API integration

#### Packages Directory (`/packages/`)
- **`/packages/qvf-core/`**: Existing QVF engine (preserved)
  - Maintains all current QVF mathematical capabilities
  - AHP engine, semantic analysis, financial modeling
  - Zero breaking changes to existing functionality

- **`/packages/shared-types/`**: Shared TypeScript/Python types
  - Ensures type consistency across applications
  - Reduces duplication and integration errors
  - Separate Python and TypeScript implementations with same contracts

- **`/packages/database/`**: Database models and migrations
  - SQLAlchemy models for data persistence
  - Alembic migrations for schema management
  - Separation of data layer concerns

#### Services Directory (`/services/`)
- **`/services/ado-sync/`**: Azure DevOps synchronization service
  - Background processing for ADO integration
  - Keeps QVF scores synchronized with ADO work items
  - Handles rate limiting and error recovery

### API Design Decision

#### RESTful API Structure
We chose REST over GraphQL for the following reasons:
- **Simplicity**: Easier to implement and test
- **FastAPI Integration**: Excellent REST support with automatic OpenAPI docs
- **Caching**: HTTP caching works well with REST endpoints
- **Team Familiarity**: REST is well-understood by most developers

#### Endpoint Organization
```
/api/v1/
├── /admin/         # Administrative operations
├── /scoring/       # QVF scoring operations  
├── /ado/           # Azure DevOps integration
├── /analytics/     # Analytics and reporting
├── /personal-metrics/  # Personal metrics (non-ADO)
└── /auth/          # Authentication
```

**Rationale**: Domain-based organization promotes clear separation of concerns and makes the API self-documenting.

### Data Architecture Decision

#### Personal Metrics Storage
We decided to create a separate database schema for personal metrics (non-ADO data) because:

- **Data Ownership**: Personal metrics belong to users, not ADO projects
- **Flexibility**: Users can define custom metrics without ADO constraints  
- **Performance**: Separate schema optimizes queries for different access patterns
- **Privacy**: Clear separation between organizational and personal data

#### Database Schema Design
- **PostgreSQL JSONB**: For flexible metadata and configuration storage
- **UUID Primary Keys**: For better distribution and security
- **Proper Indexing**: Performance optimization for common query patterns
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Data integrity and referential consistency

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Micro-frontend with Separate Repositories
- **Rejected**: Increases complexity, harder to maintain type safety, deployment challenges
- **Trade-offs**: Better team isolation vs. increased operational overhead

### Alternative 2: Pure Microservices Architecture  
- **Rejected**: Premature optimization, network overhead, distributed system complexity
- **Trade-offs**: Better scalability vs. increased development and operational complexity

### Alternative 3: Single Repository with Mixed Structure
- **Rejected**: Current pain points with unclear boundaries, hard to scale development
- **Trade-offs**: Simpler initially vs. technical debt accumulation

### Alternative 4: GraphQL API
- **Rejected**: Added complexity, learning curve, over-engineering for current needs
- **Trade-offs**: More flexible queries vs. implementation and caching complexity

## Implications
