# QVF Platform Quality Gates Requirements
**MANDATORY VERIFICATION STANDARDS FOR ALL STORY COMPLETION**

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL CONTEXT: PREVENTING COMPLETION FRAUD

**Background**: Forensic audit revealed 73% of claimed functionality was fraudulent or non-functional. These quality gates prevent future false completion claims by establishing mandatory, verifiable criteria.

**Philosophy**: **No story can be marked complete without independent verification and passing all mandatory gates.**

---

## 🎯 QUALITY GATE FRAMEWORK

### **Gate Classification System**
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Must pass 100% - blocks all deployment
- 🟡 **HIGH**: Must pass 95% - requires justification for exceptions  
- 🟢 **STANDARD**: Must pass 80% - best practices compliance

## 📝 CONCLUSION

These quality gates transform the QVF platform development from a status-reporting exercise into a verification-driven process. Every gate has specific, measurable criteria that prevent the completion fraud identified in the forensic audit.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Verification Over Claims**: All completion claims must be independently verified
2. **User-Centric Quality**: Quality gates prioritize actual user experience
3. **Automation First**: Automated verification prevents human error and bias
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Quality is maintained, not just achieved at milestones
5. **Transparent Accountability**: All quality metrics are visible and trackable

**Implementation Commitment**: These gates will be implemented in Sprint R4 and enforced for all future development work. No story will be marked complete without passing the relevant quality gates.
