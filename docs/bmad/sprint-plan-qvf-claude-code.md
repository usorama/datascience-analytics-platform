## **Conclusion**

With Claude Code as the sole developer, the entire QVF implementation can be completed in **4 focused development days** or comfortably within **1 week** including testing, documentation, and refinement. This represents a **93% reduction** in the original 7-week timeline.

The key insight: **Traditional sprint planning assumes human developer constraints that don't apply to Claude Code**. By leveraging Claude Code's capabilities - parallel processing, instant context, no communication overhead, and consistent quality - we can deliver enterprise-grade software at unprecedented speed.
