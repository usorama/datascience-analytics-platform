**CRITICAL NOTE**: This QVF system is designed to be fully operational using mathematical methods without any dependency on AI or LLM technologies. The optional Ollama integration provides enhancement opportunities when available but never creates system dependencies. Organizations can successfully deploy and use QVF with complete confidence in a mathematical foundation that gracefully degrades when AI components are unavailable.
