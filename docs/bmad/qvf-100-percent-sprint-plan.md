# QVF Platform - Path to 100% Completion Sprint Plan

**Date Created**: August 8, 2025  
**Planning Type**: BMAD Implementation Plan  
**Scope**: Critical fixes and final completion for QVF Platform  
**Target**: Achieve verified 100% completion status  

## Executive Summary

The QVF Platform has reached substantial functional completion (85-90%) but suffers from misreporting as "unavailable" due to import path issues. This sprint plan addresses critical fixes needed to achieve verified 100% completion status and UAT readiness.

**Key Achievement**: QVF Core engine is working but misreported - fixing this immediately elevates system status to "available" with full enterprise functionality.

## Implementation Strategy

### Agile Principles Applied

#### 1. Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation
- **Approach**: Fix functionality first, update documentation to match
- **Priority**: Ensure QVF Core reports correctly before documentation sync
- **Validation**: Test all documented features work in practice

#### 2. Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools
- **Collaboration**: Direct agent coordination for dependent stories
- **Communication**: Real-time updates on progress and blockers
- **Flexibility**: Adjust timelines based on actual progress

#### 3. Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation
- **Focus**: Deliver UAT-ready system that meets stakeholder needs
- **Validation**: Evidence-based completion rather than checkbox completion
- **Value**: Prioritize high-impact fixes and validation

#### 4. Responding to Change Over Following a Plan
- **Adaptability**: Adjust scope based on findings during validation
- **Risk Response**: Address issues immediately as they're discovered
- **Optimization**: Add polish and optimization as time permits

### Continuous Integration Approach

#### Quality Gates at Each Story
1. **Functional Validation**: Every change tested immediately
2. **Documentation Sync**: Updates must reflect actual functionality  
3. **Performance Check**: Key operations benchmarked
4. **Integration Test**: End-to-end workflows validated

#### Rollback Strategy
- **Immediate**: Revert changes if critical functionality breaks
- **Documentation**: Maintain backup of previous documentation states
- **Testing**: Validate system stability after each major change
