# Acceptance Criteria
acceptance-criteria: |
  - [ ] All technical documentation reflects actual implemented functionality
  - [ ] Architecture documents align with current monorepo structure
  - [ ] Implementation guides updated with working code examples
  - [ ] API documentation reflects all functional endpoints
  - [ ] User guides updated for current dashboard functionality

# Technical Constraints
constraints: |
  - Must preserve technical accuracy while updating status
  - Cannot remove historical architecture decisions and rationale
  - Must maintain consistency across technical and business documentation
  - Should include working code examples and configuration
  - Must reflect actual file structure and implementation patterns
  - Should provide clear upgrade path from documentation to reality

# Implementation Context
architectural-guidance: |
  Documentation audit reveals significant gaps between documented and
  implemented functionality. Many guides reference planned features as
  if they were incomplete, when they are actually functional.
  
  Key documentation areas needing sync:
  - API documentation vs actual endpoints
  - Frontend component guides vs implemented dashboards
  - Deployment guides vs current Docker setup
  - Architecture diagrams vs monorepo structure
  - Configuration examples vs working setups

# User Story: Documentation Reality Sync

## Business Context
As a developer, administrator, or stakeholder working with the QVF Platform, I need documentation that accurately reflects the current implemented functionality so that I can effectively use, deploy, maintain, and extend the system without confusion about what is planned versus what is actually working.

This story addresses the critical gap where documentation describes the system as if it were still in development, when in fact most functionality is implemented and operational.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **API Documentation Update**: Reflect all functional endpoints with working examples
2. **Architecture Alignment**: Update diagrams and descriptions to match current structure
3. **Implementation Guides**: Replace planned functionality with actual working examples
4. **Configuration Documentation**: Provide working configuration examples
5. **Troubleshooting Guides**: Include solutions for common issues (like QVF Core imports)

### Implementation Details

**Documentation Categories Requiring Updates**:

#### 1. API Documentation
**Current Issue**: API docs may reference planned endpoints
**Required Update**: Document all working endpoints with examples
```bash
# Working QVF API endpoints that need documentation:
GET  /api/qvf/health        # QVF Core status (now returns "available")
GET  /api/qvf/criteria      # Available scoring criteria
POST /api/qvf/score         # Score calculation with work items
GET  /api/qvf/test          # Test calculation with sample data
GET  /api/auth/me           # Current user information
POST /api/auth/login        # Authentication endpoint
```

#### 2. Frontend Documentation
**Current Issue**: Dashboard guides reference incomplete features
**Required Update**: Document functional dashboard capabilities
- Executive Dashboard: Fully operational with QVF scoring
- Product Owner Dashboard: Functional work item management
- Scrum Master Dashboard: Team analytics working
- Authentication: JWT-based role access implemented

#### 3. Architecture Documentation
**Current Issue**: Some docs describe planned monorepo structure
**Required Update**: Reflect actual working monorepo implementation
```
qvf-platform/
├── apps/
│   ├── api/          # ✅ FastAPI backend (functional)
│   └── web/          # ✅ Next.js frontend (functional)
├── packages/         # Structure exists, ready for shared code
└── services/         # ✅ QVF Core integration working
```

#### 4. Deployment Documentation
**Current Issue**: May reference incomplete Docker setup
**Required Update**: Document working containerization
- Docker Compose setup functional
- Environment configuration working
- Database initialization operational
- Development and production modes available

#### 5. Configuration Guides
**Current Issue**: Example configs may not reflect working setup
**Required Update**: Provide tested, working configuration examples
- Database connection strings
- JWT authentication setup
- QVF Core configuration
- Frontend environment variables

### Documentation Audit Scope

**Files Requiring Review and Updates**:
```
docs/
├── architecture/
│   ├── api-design.md              # Update with actual endpoints
│   ├── database-schema.md         # Reflect implemented schema
│   └── adr/001-qvf-platform-architecture.md # Confirm implementation
├── bmad/
│   ├── technical-architecture-qvf.md # Update status
│   └── qvf-safe-integration.md    # Reflect current state
├── deployment/
│   ├── docker-setup.md            # Update with working Docker
│   └── environment-config.md      # Working configuration examples
└── user-guides/
    ├── dashboard-usage.md          # Update for functional dashboards
    └── api-reference.md            # Complete API documentation
```

### Testing Requirements
- Validate all documented code examples work
- Test all documented endpoints return expected results
- Verify configuration examples produce working setups
- Confirm troubleshooting guides solve actual issues
- Validate architecture diagrams reflect current structure

### Documentation Standards

**Evidence-Based Documentation**:
- All examples tested in working system
- Screenshots from actual functional interface
- Configuration examples from working deployment
- API examples with real request/response data

**Accuracy Requirements**:
- No references to "planned" or "future" functionality that exists
- Clear distinction between implemented and truly planned features
- Working examples for all documented capabilities
- Current file paths and structure references

## Implementation Guidance

### Documentation Update Process

1. **Functional Validation**: Test every documented feature/endpoint
2. **Example Generation**: Create working examples from functional system
3. **Screenshot Updates**: Capture current UI state for guides
4. **Configuration Testing**: Validate all provided configuration examples
5. **Cross-Reference Checking**: Ensure consistency across documents

### Priority Order for Updates

**Phase 1: Critical User-Facing Documentation**
- API reference with working endpoints
- Dashboard usage guides with current functionality
- Deployment guide with working Docker setup

**Phase 2: Technical Documentation**
- Architecture documents alignment
- Configuration guides with tested examples
- Troubleshooting guides with QVF Core fixes

**Phase 3: Comprehensive Documentation**
- Advanced configuration options
- Extension and customization guides
- Performance tuning documentation

### Quality Gates

**Before Documentation Update**:
- [ ] Feature functionality validated in working system
- [ ] Examples tested and confirmed working
- [ ] Screenshots captured from current interface
- [ ] Configuration tested in clean environment

**After Documentation Update**:
- [ ] External reviewer can follow documentation successfully
- [ ] All links and references work correctly
- [ ] No contradictions with other documentation
- [ ] Clear distinction between current and future capabilities

## Definition of Done
- [ ] API documentation reflects all functional endpoints with working examples
- [ ] Architecture documents align with implemented monorepo structure
- [ ] Dashboard guides show current functional capabilities with screenshots
- [ ] Deployment guides provide working Docker and environment setup
- [ ] Configuration examples are tested and functional
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides include QVF Core import resolution
- [ ] All documentation cross-references are accurate and current
- [ ] External validation confirms documentation accuracy

## Success Metrics
- Zero instances of documentation claiming features are "planned" when they exist
- 100% of documented examples work in current system
- New users can successfully deploy and use system following documentation
- Support requests decrease due to accurate troubleshooting guides
- Development velocity increases with accurate technical documentation

## Impact Assessment
**Before**: Confusion about what's implemented vs planned, deployment difficulties, support overhead
**After**: Clear understanding of system capabilities, smooth deployment experience, self-service troubleshooting

This story transforms the QVF Platform documentation from development-phase guides to production-ready documentation that accurately represents the substantial functional system that has been implemented.
