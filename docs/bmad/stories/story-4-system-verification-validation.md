# User Story: System Verification & Validation

## Business Context
As a project stakeholder preparing for User Acceptance Testing (UAT), I need comprehensive verification that the QVF Platform is genuinely 85-90% complete and functionally ready for business user validation, so that I can confidently proceed with UAT planning and eventual production deployment.

This story provides the final validation that bridges development completion claims with business readiness, ensuring that stakeholders can trust the system is truly ready for the next phase.

## Technical Requirements

**Expected Results**:
```json
{
  "status": "available",
  "qvf_core": true,
  "criteria_engine": true,
  "ai_features": true/false,
  "message": "QVF Core engine fully operational"
}
```

#### 2. API Layer Validation
**Objective**: Verify all API endpoints function correctly with proper error handling
**Test Coverage**:
```bash
# Authentication Endpoints

4. Verify score appears in Executive Dashboard
5. Confirm ranking updates across all dashboards
6. Validate score persistence and accuracy
```

**Test Scenario 2: Stakeholder Comparison Process**
```
1. Login as Executive
2. Initiate pairwise comparison session
3. Complete comparison matrix
4. Verify consistency validation
5. Apply weights to work item scoring
6. Confirm updated priorities across dashboards
```

**Test Scenario 3: Cross-Role Collaboration**
```
1. Product Owner creates epic with work items
2. Scrum Master reviews in team dashboard
3. Executive views in portfolio dashboard
