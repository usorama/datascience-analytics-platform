# Project Context
epic: QVF Platform - Path to 100% Completion
story: Story 2 - Update Status Reporting Accuracy
priority: high
estimated-effort: 1 hour
dependencies: ["Story 1 - Fix QVF Core Import Path Resolution"]

# Acceptance Criteria
acceptance-criteria: |
  - [ ] Progress tracking documents updated with accurate completion status
  - [ ] Status inconsistencies between documentation and implementation resolved
  - [ ] Implementation reality assessment reflects current functional state
  - [ ] Sprint plan updated to reflect actual remaining work
  - [ ] All status metrics align with functional system validation
  - [ ] Documentation reflects 85-90% completion with specific remaining tasks

# Technical Constraints
constraints: |
  - Must maintain historical progress tracking for audit purposes
  - Cannot overstate completion without functional validation
  - Must clearly identify remaining work items for UAT preparation
  - Should align with established BMAD documentation standards
  - Must preserve implementation history and lessons learned
  - Should provide clear next steps for final completion

# Implementation Context
architectural-guidance: |
  Current status reporting shows discrepancies:
  - Documentation claims varied completion percentages
  - Reality assessment shows 85-90% functional completion
  - Progress tracking needs to reflect QVF Core fix
  - Frontend/backend integration status needs clarification
  
  Key files to update:
  - /docs/bmad/qvf-progress.md - Main progress tracker
  - /docs/bmad/qvf-project-status-reality-assessment.md - Reality check
  - /docs/bmad/qvf-frontend-sprint-plan.md - Sprint status

# User Story: Update Status Reporting Accuracy

## Business Context
As a project stakeholder, I need accurate and consistent status reporting across all documentation so that I can make informed decisions about UAT preparation, resource allocation, and go-live planning based on the true state of the QVF Platform implementation.

This story ensures that progress tracking reflects the reality of a functional system that is 85-90% complete with specific remaining tasks, rather than the inconsistent status reporting currently in documentation.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Progress Tracking Alignment**: Update main progress document with accurate completion status
2. **Reality Assessment Sync**: Ensure implementation reality matches documented status
3. **Sprint Plan Updates**: Reflect actual remaining work items and priorities
4. **Metrics Consistency**: Align all completion percentages across documents

### Implementation Details

**Current Status Inconsistencies Identified**:
- Progress document shows various completion percentages
- Some documents claim features "ready to begin" when they're actually functional
- QVF Core availability status was incorrect (fixed in Story 1)
- Frontend completion status varies between 85-90% across documents

**Updated Status Framework**:
```yaml
System Status:
  Overall: 85-90% Complete
  QVF Backend: 90% Complete (functional with integration)
  API Layer: 90% Complete (all endpoints working)
  Frontend: 85% Complete (dashboards functional, polish needed)
  Integration: 80% Complete (core workflows operational)
  Testing: 75% Complete (manual validation done, automated testing needed)
```

### Documentation Updates Required

**Primary Files**:
1. `/docs/bmad/qvf-progress.md`
   - Update overall progress to 85-90% complete
   - Reflect QVF Core "available" status
   - Align sprint completion status
   - Update remaining work estimates

2. `/docs/bmad/qvf-project-status-reality-assessment.md`
   - Confirm functional system status
   - Update completion metrics
   - Align with QVF Core fixes
   - Clarify UAT readiness

3. `/docs/bmad/qvf-frontend-sprint-plan.md`
   - Update sprint completion status
   - Reflect functional dashboard state
   - Identify specific polish items needed

### Status Reporting Standards
Establish consistent terminology:
- **"Available"**: QVF Core engine operational and accessible
- **"Functional"**: Features working end-to-end with minor polish needed
- **"Complete"**: Features fully implemented, tested, and production-ready
- **"UAT Ready"**: System functional for user acceptance testing

### Testing Requirements
- Cross-reference all status claims with functional validation
- Ensure completion percentages are evidence-based
- Validate that "complete" features are genuinely finished
- Confirm remaining work items are accurately identified

## Implementation Guidance

### Status Update Process
1. **Functional Validation**: Verify each claimed completion with system testing
2. **Evidence-Based Reporting**: Base percentages on demonstrable functionality
3. **Remaining Work Identification**: Clearly specify what's needed for 100%
4. **UAT Readiness Assessment**: Determine current readiness for user testing

### Completion Criteria Definitions
- **Backend (90% Complete)**: QVF Core operational, API endpoints working, minor optimization needed
- **Frontend (85% Complete)**: All dashboards functional, authentication working, UI polish needed
- **Integration (80% Complete)**: Core workflows operational, performance testing needed
- **Overall (85-90% Complete)**: System functional for UAT, production preparation needed

### Remaining Work Categorization
**Critical Path Items**:
- Performance testing and optimization
- User acceptance testing execution
- Production deployment preparation
- Documentation finalization

**Nice-to-Have Items**:
- UI/UX polish and refinement
- Advanced analytics features
- Additional testing scenarios
- Training material development

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All progress documents show consistent 85-90% completion status
- [ ] QVF Core status updated to "available" across all documentation
- [ ] Remaining work items clearly identified and prioritized
- [ ] Sprint status reflects actual functional state
- [ ] UAT readiness accurately assessed and documented
- [ ] Historical progress preserved while correcting current status
- [ ] Next steps clearly defined for reaching 100% completion

## Success Metrics
- Zero discrepancies in completion percentages across documents
- Clear alignment between documented and functional system status
- Accurate remaining work estimates (10-15% of total scope)
- Stakeholder confidence in status reporting accuracy
- Clear path to UAT and production deployment

This story ensures that stakeholders have accurate, consistent information about the QVF Platform's substantial progress and clear understanding of the remaining work needed to achieve full production readiness.
