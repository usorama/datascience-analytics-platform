# Technical Constraints
constraints: |
  - Must use existing dashboard generator framework from /src/datascience_platform/dashboard/generative/
  - Integration with QVF orchestrator API for real-time portfolio data
  - Mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind CSS
  - Charts must use Tremor React components for consistency

# Implementation Context
architectural-guidance: |
  The Executive Dashboard should extend the existing dashboard generation system
  while providing specialized executive-level analytics. Follow the established
  pattern in the dashboard generator but create executive-specific components.
  
  Key files to reference and extend:
  - /src/datascience_platform/dashboard/generative/generator.py - Base generator patterns
  - /src/datascience_platform/dashboard/generative/components.py - Component generation
  - /src/datascience_platform/qvf/api/main.py - QVF API endpoints
  - /src/datascience_platform/qvf/orchestration/orchestrator.py - Data orchestration
  
  Create new executive-specific components:
  - /src/datascience_platform/qvf/ui/executive/ - Executive dashboard module
  - Executive dashboard should be a specialized instance of the general dashboard
  
  Data Architecture:
  The dashboard must integrate with the existing QVF data flow:
  1. QVF Orchestrator -> Portfolio Analytics API
  2. Executive Dashboard -> Specialized executive views  
  3. Real-time updates via WebSocket for live data
  4. Caching strategy for large portfolio datasets

# User Story: Executive Strategy Dashboard

## Business Context
As a C-Suite executive responsible for strategic portfolio management and investment decisions, I need a comprehensive dashboard that provides real-time visibility into our organizational value delivery. The dashboard must enable me to quickly assess portfolio health, identify our highest-value strategic initiatives, and make informed investment decisions that optimize our return on strategic objectives.

This executive dashboard is critical for:
- **Strategic Decision Making**: Rapid assessment of portfolio performance and investment allocation
- **Board Reporting**: Executive-ready visualizations and export capabilities for board meetings
- **Risk Management**: Early identification of strategic risks and mitigation opportunities  
- **Value Optimization**: Data-driven insights to maximize business value delivery
- **Alignment Monitoring**: Ensuring all initiatives align with company OKRs and strategic themes

## Detailed Functional Requirements

The dashboard must provide an immediate, comprehensive view of portfolio health:

**Primary Metrics Display**:
- **Total Investment**: Current and projected investment across all strategic initiatives
- **Strategic Alignment Score**: Percentage of portfolio aligned with company OKRs (target: >80%)
- **Value Delivered**: Cumulative business value delivered quarter-over-quarter  
- **Portfolio Risk Score**: Aggregate risk assessment with trend indicators
- **Time to Value**: Average time from initiative approval to business value realization

**Visual Requirements**:
- Large, prominent KPI cards with trend indicators (up/down arrows, percentage change)
- Color-coded health indicators (green/yellow/red) based on predefined thresholds
- Sparkline charts showing 12-month trends for each primary metric
- Real-time update indicators showing data freshness

### 2. Strategic Investment Distribution
Executives need to understand how investment is distributed across strategic themes:

**Investment Breakdown**:
- **By Strategic Theme**: Pie chart showing investment allocation across company strategic themes
- **By Business Unit**: Investment distribution across different business units or product lines
- **By Initiative Type**: Breakdown between new product development, operational improvement, compliance, etc.
- **ROI Analysis**: Expected vs. actual return on investment for completed initiatives

**Interactive Features**:
- Click on any segment to drill down to specific initiatives within that category
- Toggle between dollar amounts and percentage views
- Historical comparison slider to show investment evolution over time
- Export capability for board presentation materials

### 3. Top Strategic Initiatives
Display the highest-value initiatives with comprehensive context:

**Initiative Display** (Top 20 by QVF score):

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### Data Integration Architecture
```python
class ExecutiveDashboardOrchestrator:
    """Orchestrates data preparation for executive dashboard."""
    
    def __init__(self, qvf_engine: QVFEngine):
        self.qvf_engine = qvf_engine
        self.cache_manager = ExecutiveCacheManager()
        self.real_time_updater = RealTimeUpdater()
    
    async def get_portfolio_overview(self) -> PortfolioOverview:
        """Get comprehensive portfolio metrics for executive view."""
        # Implementation integrates with existing QVF orchestrator
        return await self.qvf_engine.calculate_portfolio_metrics()
    
    async def get_strategic_initiatives(self, limit: int = 20) -> List[ExecutiveInitiative]:
        """Get top strategic initiatives ranked by QVF score."""
        # Leverage existing QVF ranking algorithms
        return await self.qvf_engine.get_ranked_initiatives(limit)
```

### Performance Optimization Strategy
- **Data Caching**: Aggressive caching of portfolio-level metrics with 5-minute refresh
- **Incremental Loading**: Load overview metrics first, then detailed data asynchronously
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large lists of initiatives (1000+ items)
- **Chart Optimization**: Pre-aggregate chart data on the backend
- **Mobile Optimization**: Simplified mobile views with essential metrics only

### Security and Access Control
- **Role-Based Access**: Executive role required for dashboard access
