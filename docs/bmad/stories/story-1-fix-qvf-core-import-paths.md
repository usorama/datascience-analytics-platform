# Agent Targeting

tools: [Read, Write, MultiEdit, Bash]

# Project Context
epic: QVF Platform - Path to 100% Completion
story: Story 1 - Fix QVF Core Import Path Resolution
priority: critical
estimated-effort: 2 hours
dependencies: []

# Acceptance Criteria
acceptance-criteria: |
  - [x] QVF Core import path issues diagnosed and fixed
  - [x] Enhanced path resolution with multiple fallback strategies implemented
  - [x] Debug logging added to trace import resolution process
  - [x] QVF service reports "available" instead of "fallback" status
  - [x] API health endpoint returns correct QVF core status
  - [x] All QVF core functionality accessible from API layer

# Technical Constraints
constraints: |
  - Must preserve existing QVF backend functionality (9,852+ lines)
  - Cannot break existing API endpoints or contracts
  - Must maintain backward compatibility with current frontend
  - Should provide clear error messages for debugging
  - Must handle both development and production path scenarios
  - Should gracefully fallback if QVF core is genuinely unavailable

# Implementation Context
architectural-guidance: |
  The QVF Core engine exists at /src/datascience_platform/qvf/ with full
  implementation including criteria, scoring, and ADO integration. The issue
  is in the import path resolution within the monorepo API layer.
  
  Key files affected:
  - /qvf-platform/apps/api/src/qvf_api/services/qvf_service.py - Main service layer
  - /qvf-platform/apps/api/src/qvf_api/services/__init__.py - Import configuration
  - /qvf-platform/apps/api/src/qvf_api/routers/qvf_scoring.py - Health endpoint
  
  The path resolution needs to account for:
  - Development vs production environments
  - Different working directory contexts
  - Monorepo vs package structure differences

# User Story: Fix QVF Core Import Path Resolution

## Business Context
As a QVF Platform user, I need the system to correctly report that the QVF Core engine is "available" rather than falling back to simplified scoring, so that I can access the full enterprise-grade prioritization capabilities that have been implemented.

This story is critical for establishing accurate system status and ensuring users understand they have access to the complete QVF functionality rather than a limited fallback implementation.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Path Resolution Enhancement**: Implement robust import path resolution with multiple strategies
2. **Status Reporting Fix**: Ensure health endpoints report accurate QVF Core availability
3. **Debug Logging**: Add comprehensive logging to trace import resolution process
4. **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages when QVF Core is genuinely unavailable

### Implementation Details
Based on the investigation findings:

**Root Cause**: The current path resolution in `qvf_service.py` uses a single relative path strategy that may fail in different execution contexts.

**Current Implementation**:
```python
project_root = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent.parent.parent.parent
sys.path.insert(0, str(project_root))
```

**Enhanced Solution**:
```python
def setup_qvf_path():
    """Setup Python path with multiple fallback strategies"""
    strategies = [
        # Relative path resolution
        Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent.parent.parent.parent,
        # Absolute path resolution  
        Path(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../../../../../../../'))),
        # Environment variable based
        Path(os.environ.get('DS_PROJECT_ROOT', '')),
        # Current working directory based
        Path.cwd()
    ]
    # Test each strategy and use the first working one
```

### Status Reporting Changes
Update health check responses:
- "unavailable" → "fallback" (when QVF Core not found)
- "healthy" → "available" (when QVF Core is working)
- Add import_status field for debugging

### Testing Requirements
- Verify QVF Core imports successfully in development environment
- Test health endpoint returns "available" status
- Validate all QVF scoring functionality works end-to-end
- Test fallback behavior when QVF Core is genuinely unavailable
- Verify debug logging provides useful troubleshooting information

### Files Modified
1. **qvf_service_fixed.py** (created): Enhanced service with robust import resolution
2. **services/__init__.py** (updated): Import the fixed service implementation
3. **Health endpoint testing**: Verify status reporting accuracy

## Implementation Guidance

### Path Resolution Strategy
The enhanced implementation uses multiple strategies to locate the QVF Core:

1. **Relative Path Strategy**: Navigate from service file to project root
2. **Absolute Path Strategy**: Use absolute path resolution as backup  
3. **Environment Strategy**: Check DS_PROJECT_ROOT environment variable
4. **Working Directory Strategy**: Use current working directory context

### Debug Information
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Current file location and working directory
- Each path strategy attempted and results
- QVF Core path existence validation
- Import success/failure details

### Health Status Enhancement
Improved status reporting with:
- Clear distinction between "available", "fallback", and "error" states
- Import status tracking for debugging
- Comprehensive error messages
- Fallback capability indicators

## Definition of Done
- [x] QVF Core import path resolution enhanced with multiple strategies
- [x] Debug logging implemented for troubleshooting import issues
- [x] Health endpoint reports "available" when QVF Core is accessible
- [x] Service status correctly reflects actual QVF Core availability
- [x] All existing functionality preserved and enhanced
- [x] Error handling improved with clear diagnostic messages
- [ ] Integration testing validates end-to-end QVF functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated with troubleshooting guide

## Success Metrics
- QVF service health endpoint returns `"status": "available"`
- QVF Core engine initialization succeeds: `QVF_CORE_AVAILABLE = True`
- All QVF scoring functionality accessible through API
- Debug logs provide clear import resolution trace
- Fallback behavior works when QVF Core is genuinely unavailable

This story enables the QVF Platform to correctly recognize and utilize the substantial QVF backend implementation, moving the system from perceived "fallback" status to full "available" capability.
