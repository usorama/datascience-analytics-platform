# **Test Scenarios and Data Sets for QVF Implementation**
**Quantified Value Framework - Comprehensive Testing Strategy**

---

## **Overview**

This document provides comprehensive test data and scenarios to ensure thorough testing of the QVF (Quantified Value Framework) system. All test data is concrete and reproducible, designed to validate both the mathematical foundations and the enhanced capabilities including optional AI features and SAFe Agent coaching.

### **Testing Philosophy**

- **Mathematical Foundation First**: All tests validate that mathematical methods work perfectly without any AI dependencies
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Tests validate that AI and coaching features enhance but never replace the mathematical foundation
- **Graceful Degradation**: Tests ensure seamless fallback when enhancement features are unavailable
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Test data reflects actual enterprise environments and stakeholder behaviors
