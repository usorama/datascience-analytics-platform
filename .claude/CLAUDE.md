## üö® MANDATORY QUALITY GATES (ALL AGENTS MUST COMPLY)

**CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT NOTICE**: These quality gates are ARCHITECTURALLY ENFORCED and cannot be bypassed. Failure to comply will result in blocked execution.

### Configuration Loading Requirement
**MANDATORY**: All agents MUST load configuration from `.claude/config/multi-agent-config.yaml` before any action.

```yaml
# Configuration loading is validated via hooks - non-compliance blocks execution
quality_gates:
  template_compliance: "mandatory"
  dod_completion: "mandatory"  
  evidence_collection: "mandatory"
  verification_approval: "mandatory"
```

### Template Compliance Requirement
**MANDATORY**: All document outputs MUST follow template structure from `.claude/docs/templates/`:

- **Story Documents**: MUST use `story-template.md` structure (12 required sections, 23 mandatory fields)
- **PRD Documents**: MUST use `prd-template.md` structure 
- **Review Documents**: MUST use `review-template.md` structure

**ENFORCEMENT**: Template compliance is validated via PreToolUse hooks. Non-compliant outputs are automatically rejected.

### Definition of Done (DoD) Enforcement
**MANDATORY**: ALL story status changes to "Review" or "Done" MUST have 100% DoD checklist completion:

#### Required DoD Checklist Items:
- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] All tasks and subtasks completed [x]
- [ ] Code follows project coding standards
- [ ] No linter errors or warnings introduced
- [ ] All tests implemented and passing
- [ ] Evidence collection complete
- [ ] File List complete and accurate

**ENFORCEMENT**: DoD completion is validated via hooks. Stories cannot advance with incomplete DoD items.

### Evidence Collection Requirement
**MANDATORY**: All claims and completions MUST be backed by concrete evidence:

#### Required Evidence Types:
1. **Test Results**: Actual test execution logs showing 100% pass rate
2. **Build Output**: Build logs showing zero errors/warnings
3. **Functionality Demo**: Screenshots or detailed verification of working features
4. **Quality Validation**: Code review results and performance metrics

**ENFORCEMENT**: Evidence validation occurs via hooks. Insufficient evidence blocks story advancement.

### Workflow State Management
**MANDATORY**: All agent handoffs MUST include proper state management:

- **State Persistence**: Current workflow state documented in `docs/workflow_state/`
- **Handoff Artifacts**: Required artifacts provided in `docs/handoffs/`
- **Status Tracking**: Accurate status updates with verification
- **Context Preservation**: Complete context provided for next agent

### Document Access Control
**ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRAINT**: Agents can ONLY access:

‚úÖ **Allowed Paths**:
- `docs/sharded/**/*.md` (sharded documents only)
- `docs/templates/**/*.md` (template definitions)
- `docs/standards/**/*.md` (quality standards)
- `docs/stories/**/*.md` (story documents)
- `.claude/config/**/*.yaml` (configuration files)

‚ùå **BLOCKED Paths**:
- `docs/archive/**/*` (full documents hidden from agents)
- `docs/draft/**/*` (incomplete work not accessible)
- `.bmad-core/**/*` (BMAD source files protected)

**ENFORCEMENT**: Directory restrictions enforced by Claude Code security boundaries + configuration.

### Quality Gate Execution Order
**MANDATORY SEQUENCE**: All agents must follow this execution order:

1. **Load Configuration** (`.claude/config/multi-agent-config.yaml`)
2. **Verify Document Access** (only sharded/approved documents)
3. **Load Required Templates** (for output structure)
4. **Execute Task** (following template structure)
5. **Complete DoD Checklist** (100% completion required)
6. **Collect Evidence** (concrete proof of all claims)
7. **Request Verification** (independent validation)
8. **Update Workflow State** (for next agent handoff)

### Failure Handling Protocol
**MANDATORY ACTIONS** when quality gates fail:

- **Template Violation**: STOP execution, request template compliance
- **DoD Incomplete**: BLOCK status advancement, require completion
- **Evidence Missing**: PREVENT story progression, demand concrete proof
- **Verification Failed**: ROLLBACK state, address verification issues

### Hook Validation System
**AUTOMATIC ENFORCEMENT**: Quality gates are enforced via executable hooks:

- `validate_template_compliance.sh` - Ensures template structure compliance
- `validate_dod_completion.sh` - Enforces 100% DoD checklist completion
- `validate_evidence.sh` - Validates concrete evidence provision

**CRITICAL**: These hooks run automatically via Claude Code's PreToolUse system and will BLOCK execution on failure.
