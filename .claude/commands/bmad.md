# BMAD Planning Workflow Initiation

Starting BMAD planning for: "$ARGUMENTS"

I'll use the **master-orchestrator** agent to coordinate the full BMAD planning sequence:

## Phase 1: Strategic Planning
1. **bmad-analyst**: Requirements gathering and user research
2. **bmad-product-strategist**: Feature prioritization and roadmap planning  
3. **strategic-architect**: System design and technical architecture
4. **ðŸš¨ Human Review Gate**: Approve planning documents before proceeding

## Phase 2: Story Creation
5. **bmad-scrum-master**: Context engineering and story decomposition
6. **ðŸš¨ Human Review Gate**: Validate story files and acceptance criteria

## Phase 3: Implementation Coordination  
7. **Specialist Agent Selection**: Based on story requirements and target agents
8. **git-checkpoint**: Safety checkpoints throughout implementation
9. **Quality Gates**: Testing, review, and integration workflows

This provides the complete Governed Agentic Agile Loop (GAAL) workflow with governance gates and safety measures.
