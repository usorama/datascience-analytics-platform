# Development State Rollback

Rolling back to previous state: "$ARGUMENTS"

I'll use the **git-checkpoint** agent to:

1. **Show Rollback Options**: Display recent checkpoints with context and timestamps
2. **Analyze Impact**: Show what changes will be affected by rollback
3. **Provide Rollback Types**: 
   - **Soft rollback**: Keep changes in working directory
   - **Hard rollback**: Completely restore previous state
   - **Selective rollback**: Choose specific files to rollback
   - **Recovery branch**: Rollback on new branch preserving current work
4. **Execute Safely**: Perform rollback with emergency backup
5. **Report Results**: Confirm rollback and show current status

This gives you safe, intelligent rollback capabilities with multiple recovery options.
