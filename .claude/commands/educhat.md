## Educational Chat Interface Requirements

### Core Principles
- **Student-Centered**: Every element must support the learning experience
- **Empathetic Design**: Visual design should feel supportive and encouraging
- **Age-Appropriate**: Suitable for students aged 13-18 with learning challenges
- **Accessibility First**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Comprehensive Review Areas

### Message Display Standards
- **User Messages**: 
  - Right-aligned with `ml-auto max-w-[80%]`
  - Background: `bg-primary text-primary-foreground`
  - Border radius: `rounded-2xl rounded-br-md` (speech bubble effect)
  - Proper spacing with `space-y-4` between messages
- **AI Tutor Messages**: 
  - Left-aligned with `mr-auto max-w-[80%]`
  - Background: `bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground`
  - Border radius: `rounded-2xl rounded-bl-md`
  - Include supportive, encouraging tone
- **System Messages**: 
  - Centered with subtle styling
  - Use `text-muted-foreground` for system notifications
  - Clear distinction from conversation messages

### Interaction Patterns
- **Typing Indicators**: 
  - Subtle animation using progress color variables
  - Position: left-aligned like AI messages
  - Use dots or pulse animation with `animate-pulse`
- **Message Timestamps**: 
  - Style: `text-xs text-muted-foreground`
  - Position: Adjacent to messages, not intrusive
  - Format: Student-friendly time display
- **Message Actions**: 
  - Hover states reveal options (copy, regenerate, helpful/not helpful)
  - Icons from Lucide React library
  - Accessible keyboard shortcuts
- **Send Button**: 
  - Prominent primary button with send icon
  - Disabled state when input is empty
  - Loading state during AI response generation

### Student-Friendly Features
- **Large Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px (`h-10`) for mobile interaction
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Easy distinction between participants
- **Readable Typography**: `text-base leading-relaxed` for message content
- **Accessible Colors**: High contrast ratios for students with visual impairments
- **Error Recovery**: Clear retry mechanisms for failed messages

### Real-time Feedback Systems
- **Connection Status**: 
  - Clear indicator when offline/reconnecting
  - Use supportive language, not technical jargon
  - Visual indicators using appropriate colors
- **Message Status**: 
  - Sent, delivered, failed states with appropriate icons
  - Retry functionality for failed messages
  - Clear visual feedback for each state
- **Loading States**: 
  - Skeleton loading for message history
  - Smooth transitions to prevent jarring experiences
  - Progress indicators for longer operations

### Empathetic Design Elements
- **Encouraging Empty States**: 
  - Positive messaging when no conversation yet
  - Suggested conversation starters
  - Welcoming tone that reduces anxiety
- **Progress Celebration**: 
  - Visual feedback for learning milestones within chat
  - Congratulatory messages for achievements
  - Progress indicators that motivate continued learning
- **Supportive Error Messages**: 
  - Never blame the student for technical issues
  - Offer clear next steps for resolution
  - Maintain encouraging, patient tone
- **Motivational Elements**: 
  - Subtle encouragement in interface design
  - Learning streak indicators
  - Achievement notifications integrated into chat flow

### Learning Context Integration
- **Subject Awareness**: 
  - Visual indicators for current learning topic
  - Context-aware suggestions and follow-ups
  - Integration with learning progress tracking
- **Educational Features**: 
  - Code syntax highlighting for programming topics
  - Mathematical equation rendering for math subjects
  - Image upload support for visual learning
  - Voice input for accessibility and engagement

### Accessibility & Inclusion
- **Screen Reader Support**: 
  - Proper ARIA labels for all interactive elements
  - Live regions for new message announcements
  - Clear roles and landmarks for navigation
- **Keyboard Navigation**: 
  - Tab order follows logical conversation flow
  - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
  - Focus management for dynamic content
- **Motor Accessibility**: 
  - Large touch targets for students with motor challenges
  - Voice input alternatives to typing
  - Adjustable typing assistance features
- **Cognitive Accessibility**: 
  - Simple, consistent interaction patterns
  - Clear visual cues for all actions
  - Reduced cognitive load in interface design

## Analysis Framework

### Review Process
1. **Message Flow Analysis**: Check conversation layout and visual hierarchy
2. **Interaction Review**: Verify all interactive elements meet standards
3. **Empathy Assessment**: Evaluate supportive and encouraging elements
4. **Accessibility Audit**: Test screen reader and keyboard navigation
5. **Learning Integration**: Check educational feature implementation
6. **Performance Check**: Verify smooth real-time interactions

## Educational Chat Interface Analysis

### Message Display Issues
- [Specific issues with message styling, alignment, spacing]

### Interaction Pattern Issues  
- [Problems with buttons, inputs, real-time features]

### Student Experience Issues
- [Age-appropriateness, empathy, motivation concerns]

### Accessibility Issues
- [Screen reader, keyboard, motor, cognitive accessibility problems]

### Learning Integration Issues
- [Educational context, progress tracking, subject-specific features]

```

### Recommendations
After identifying issues, provide specific code improvements that:
- Enhance the educational chat experience
- Improve accessibility for diverse learners
- Integrate better with learning objectives
- Create more empathetic and supportive interactions
- Optimize for student engagement and motivation

## Success Criteria
A successful educational chat interface should:
- Feel welcoming and supportive to anxious students
- Provide clear, accessible communication for all ability levels
- Integrate seamlessly with learning progress and goals
- Encourage continued engagement through positive design
- Handle errors gracefully without frustrating students
- Support multiple learning modalities (text, voice, visual)

Remember: Every design decision should ask "How does this help a student learn better?" The chat interface is often the primary touchpoint between student and AI tutor, making it critical for educational success.
