interface TenantArchitecture {
  isolation: 'database' | 'schema' | 'row-level';
  sharedServices: string[];
  tenantSpecificServices: string[];
  dataPartitioning: PartitioningStrategy;
  customization: CustomizationLevel;
}

// Implementation strategy
const educationalTenancy = {
  isolation: 'schema', // Balance of isolation and efficiency
  sharedServices: ['authentication', 'notifications', 'analytics'],
  tenantSpecificServices: ['curriculum', 'assessments', 'reporting'],
  dataPartitioning: {
    students: 'tenant_id',
    content: 'organization_id',
    progress: 'tenant_id + student_id'
  }
};
```

#### Learning Analytics Architecture
```typescript
// Real-time learning analytics pipeline
interface LearningAnalyticsArchitecture {
  dataIngestion: {
    studentInteractions: EventStream;
    assessmentResults: EventStream;
    contentEngagement: EventStream;
  };
  processing: {
    realTimeAnalytics: StreamProcessor;
    batchAnalytics: BatchProcessor;
    mlPipeline: MachineLearningPipeline;
  };
  storage: {
    hotData: 'Redis/MemoryDB';
    warmData: 'PostgreSQL';

// AI service integration for personalized tutoring
interface AITutoringArchitecture {
  aiServices: {
    primary: 'Gemini 2.5 Flash';
    fallback: 'OpenAI GPT-4';
    specialized: ['Math solver', 'Writing assistant', 'Science tutor'];
  };
  contextManagement: {
    studentProfile: ContextStore;
    conversationHistory: ConversationStore;
    learningProgress: ProgressStore;
  };
  responseProcessing: {
    contentFiltering: SafetyLayer;
    ageAppropriate: ContentValidator;
    educationalValue: PedagogyValidator;
  };

  subject VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  topic VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  mastery_level DECIMAL(3,2) CHECK (mastery_level >= 0 AND mastery_level <= 1),
  embedding vector(1536), -- For AI-powered recommendations
  last_practiced TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
