### Scenario 6: Fallback Behavior Testing

**Test Command:**
```
/so --model invalid-model Create a new user authentication system
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- SuperOrchestrator detects invalid model specification
- Gracefully falls back to complexity-based automatic selection
- Applies appropriate model (likely Sonnet for implementation)
- Provides feedback about fallback behavior

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Invalid model override detected
- [ ] Graceful fallback to automatic selection
- [ ] Appropriate model selected based on complexity
- [ ] Task completed successfully despite invalid override
- [ ] Clear feedback provided about fallback

### Scenario 7: Cost Optimization Analysis

**Test Command:**
```

- [ ] Comprehensive analysis provided
- [ ] Performance optimization recommendations included
- [ ] Cost efficiency maintained
- [ ] Quality standards met

### Scenario 8: Educational Compliance Focus

**Test Command:**
```
/so Design a comprehensive student data privacy architecture that ensures COPPA compliance for users under 13 and FERPA compliance for educational records
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- SuperOrchestrator detects critical compliance requirements
- Automatically routes to Opus for complex regulatory analysis
- Provides thorough compliance architecture design
- Addresses both COPPA and FERPA requirements comprehensively

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Automatic Opus selection for compliance complexity
- [ ] Comprehensive COPPA compliance architecture
- [ ] Detailed FERPA compliance framework
- [ ] Age verification and consent workflows
- [ ] Data encryption and privacy by design
- [ ] Audit trail and monitoring requirements
