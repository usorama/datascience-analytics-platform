## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Quality-First Architecture**
- **Architectural Enforcement**: Quality gates built into system, not optional
- **Binary Completion**: 100% DoD completion required, no exceptions
- **Evidence-Based**: All claims must be backed by concrete proof
- **Template Compliance**: Mandatory document structure enforcement

### 2. **Hybrid Intelligence System**
- **Rule-Based Safety**: Instant blocking of dangerous patterns
- **LLM Decision Making**: Complex reasoning for quality and coordination
- **Risk Analysis**: Advanced pattern recognition with voice alerts
- **Project Intelligence**: Cross-project learning and analytics

### 3. **Multi-Agent Coordination**
- **28 Specialized Agents**: Expert-level capabilities across all domains
- **Context Continuity**: BMAD-enhanced document-driven state management
- **Cross-Domain Integration**: Seamless coordination between frontend, backend, full-stack, CI/CD
- **Intelligent Routing**: Natural language to expert system routing

### 4. **Continuous Improvement**
- **Automatic Learning**: Quality metrics collected from every interaction
- **Template Evolution**: Standards improve based on real-world usage
- **Pattern Recognition**: Success and failure patterns automatically identified
