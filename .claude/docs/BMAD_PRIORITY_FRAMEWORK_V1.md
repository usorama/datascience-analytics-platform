4. **Production Deployment**: If infrastructure issues arise, implement staging rollout

### Success Monitoring
- **Daily**: AI response time monitoring, PDF processing success rate
- **Weekly**: System integration percentage, production readiness score
- **Sprint End**: Quality gate verification, success criteria validation
