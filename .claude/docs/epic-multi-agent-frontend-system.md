## Executive Summary

Design and implement a streamlined 6-agent workflow system that addresses Claude Code's frontend development limitations through specialized AI agents, intelligent orchestration, and systematic knowledge gathering. This system transforms ad-hoc UI modifications into systematic, knowledge-driven implementation with natural language interface and unlimited extensibility.

## Business Problem Statement

**Current State Issues:**
- Claude Code lacks visual understanding of existing UI components
- Inconsistent design system compliance leads to UI fragmentation
- New implementations break existing patterns and architectural decisions
- No systematic research or planning before frontend changes

- Poor integration between frontend modifications and backend systems

**Impact:**
- Increased development time due to rework and bug fixes
- Inconsistent user experience across application components
- Technical debt accumulation from non-compliant implementations
- Developer frustration with unpredictable AI assistance quality

## Solution Vision

Create an intelligent 6-agent system with natural language orchestration that provides:
- **Simple Interface**: Single `/ui "describe what you want"` command with autonomous workflow detection
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Visual UI analysis, design compliance, pattern recognition through specialized agents
- **Intelligent Coordination**: Master orchestrator that manages all agents and maintains complete context
- **Unlimited Flexibility**: Sub-agent spawning for edge cases using Claude Code's Task tool
