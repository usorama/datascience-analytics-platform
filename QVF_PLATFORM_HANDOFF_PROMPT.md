## üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL CONTEXT

### Architecture Decisions (ADR-001)
The QVF Platform follows a **modern monorepo application architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

**Planned Architecture**:
```
qvf-platform/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/           # Applications (FastAPI backend + Next.js frontend)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/       # Shared libraries (qvf-core, shared-types, database)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/       # Background services (ado-sync)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/          # Development and build tools
```

**Technology Stack**:
- **Backend**: FastAPI 0.100+ with SQLAlchemy 2.0 async ORM
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with React 19, TypeScript 5+, Tailwind v4
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Redis 7+ for caching
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand + TanStack Query
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens

### Current Implementation Status

**Backend Foundation (Production-Ready)**:
- **QVF Mathematical Engine**: 20+ criteria across 5 categories with AHP integration
- **Azure DevOps Integration**: Full REST API client with connection pooling, rate limiting
- **Enterprise Architecture**: Supports 10,000+ work items, async operations, comprehensive monitoring
- **Quality Assurance**: Full test coverage with mocked and integration tests

**Database Strategy**: **SQLite-first approach** for rapid development and deployment:
- Start with SQLite for v1.0 ADO-focused release
- Migrate to PostgreSQL for v2.0 enterprise scale
- Maintains development velocity while supporting production requirements

### Key Design Patterns & Constraints

**Performance Requirements**:
- API Response Times: <200ms for most operations  
- Dashboard Load Times: <2 seconds initial, <500ms subsequent
- QVF Calculations: <5 seconds for 1000+ work items
- Support 50+ concurrent executive users

**Security & Compliance**:
- Role-based access control (Executive, Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer)
- JWT authentication with proper expiration
- Audit logging for all user actions
- Data privacy with personal metrics isolation

**Development Constraints**:
- Must use existing dashboard generator framework (`/src/datascience_platform/dashboard/generative/`)
- Integration with QVF orchestrator API for real-time data
- Mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Error boundaries required for graceful failure handling
