# Completion Enforcement Expansion Pack

## Overview

This expansion pack adds strict completion verification to the BMAD Method, preventing incomplete work from being marked as complete. It addresses the "illusion of progress" problem by enforcing binary completion status with evidence-based verification.

## Problem Solved

BMAD's comprehensive documentation can create false progress indicators when stories are marked complete with unchecked items or "90% done" explanations. This expansion pack enforces true completion through:

- Binary completion status (complete or incomplete, no partial credit)
- Mandatory verification agent with veto power
- Evidence-based completion requirements
- Git hook integration to prevent incomplete commits

## Components

### 1. Victoria - Completion Enforcer Agent
- Specialized verification agent with veto power
- Reviews all completion criteria with binary decision making
- Requires evidence (test logs, screenshots, metrics)
- Cannot be bypassed or overridden

### 2. Strict Checklists
- `story-dod-strict.md` - Binary completion checklist
- `outcome-verification.md` - Evidence collection requirements
- No allowance for partial completion or explanatory notes

### 3. Enhanced Dev Agent
- Modified workflow to include mandatory verification
- Automatic transformation to completion-enforcer before marking complete
- Blocked from setting "complete" status without approval

### 4. Git Hook Integration
- Pre-commit checks for incomplete DoD items
- Validates evidence documentation exists
- Logs any bypass attempts for audit trail

## Installation

1. Add to your project's package.json:
```json
{
  "bmadExpansionPacks": [
    "completion-enforcement"
  ]
}
```

2. Run installation:
```bash
npm run install:bmad
```

3. Install git hooks:
```bash
./.bmad-core/hooks/install-hooks.sh
```

## Usage

The enforcement is automatic once installed:

1. Dev agent completes implementation
2. Runs all tests and validations
3. Automatically transforms to Victoria
4. Victoria reviews all criteria and evidence
5. Only if approved, story marked complete
6. Git hooks prevent commits of incomplete work

## Configuration

In `core-config.yaml`:
```yaml
enforcement:
  completion_verification: mandatory
  partial_completion_allowed: false
  verification_agent_required: true
  strict_dod_enabled: true
  evidence_required: true
  git_hook_enforcement: true
```

## Benefits

- Eliminates false progress indicators
- Enforces quality through mandatory testing
- Prevents technical debt accumulation
- Improves transparency with verification records
- Maintains BMAD benefits while adding enforcement

## Requirements

- BMAD Method v4.0+
- Git repository for hook integration
- Node.js v20+
