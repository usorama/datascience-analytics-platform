# Feature Request: Completion Enforcement Expansion Pack

## Have you discussed this in Discord?
Yes, planning to discuss in #general-dev channel about the "illusion of progress" problem in AI-assisted development where incomplete work gets marked as complete.

## Problem Description
BMAD Method's comprehensive documentation approach can inadvertently create false progress indicators. Stories and epics get marked as "complete" with:
- Unchecked items explained away with notes
- "90% done" status that never reaches 100%
- Missing tests or security issues ignored
- Partial implementations counted as full credit

Real-world example: A backend marked 75% complete in Epic 7 was actually only 35-40% production-ready, with zero test coverage and hardcoded credentials.

## Proposed Solution
A **Completion Enforcement Expansion Pack** that adds:

1. **Victoria - Completion Enforcer Agent**: A verification specialist with veto power who reviews all completion claims with binary decision making (APPROVED/REJECTED)

2. **Strict DoD Checklists**: No partial credit allowed - all items must be checked or the story remains incomplete

3. **Enhanced Dev Workflow**: Automatic transformation to completion-enforcer before marking any story complete

4. **Git Hook Integration**: Pre-commit checks that block commits with incomplete DoD items

5. **Evidence Requirements**: Mandatory test logs, screenshots, and metrics for completion claims

## Why This Benefits BMad Community
- **Eliminates False Progress**: No more "75% complete" with critical features missing
- **Enforces Quality**: Tests become mandatory, not optional
- **Prevents Technical Debt**: Can't defer completion items to "next sprint"
- **Improves Trust**: Clients/stakeholders get accurate progress reports
- **Maintains BMad Benefits**: Adds enforcement layer without changing core method

## Implementation Approach
Following BMAD guiding principles:
- All natural language (markdown) implementation
- Minimal overhead for dev agents (one additional verification step)
- Implemented as expansion pack to keep core lean
- Reuses existing task patterns (create-doc, execute-checklist)
- Clear agent persona with specific expertise

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Manual code reviews**: Doesn't scale, relies on human vigilance
2. **Automated testing only**: Doesn't catch documentation/planning gaps
3. **Modifying core BMAD**: Would bloat core method, better as expansion pack
4. **External tools**: Breaks BMAD's natural language philosophy

## Questions for Community
1. Have others experienced this "illusion of progress" problem?
2. Would binary completion (no partial credit) be too strict for some teams?
3. Should evidence requirements be configurable per project?
4. Any other verification criteria we should include?

I have a working implementation tested in a real project and can submit a PR to the `next` branch following contribution guidelines.
