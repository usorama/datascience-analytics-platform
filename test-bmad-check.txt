BMAD Resources Accessibility Check
===================================
Test Date: 2025-08-09
Test Location: /Users/umasankrudhya/Projects/ds-package

## Status: ❌ BMAD Resources NOT ACCESSIBLE

### Checked Locations:
1. ❌ /Users/umasankrudhya/Projects/ds-package/.bmad-core/ - Directory exists but agent files not found
2. ❌ /Users/umasankrudhya/Projects/ds-package/.claude/ - Directory exists but hook files not accessible
3. ❌ /Users/umasankrudhya/.claude/agents/ - Agent files not found in global location
4. ❌ /Users/umasankrudhya/.claude/hooks/ - Hook files not found in global location
5. ❌ /Users/umasankrudhya/.bmad-core/ - Global BMAD directory not accessible

### What IS Accessible:
✅ Project documentation at docs/bmad/qvf-progress.md (1,028 lines)
✅ BMAD-related progress tracking documents
✅ QVF Platform implementation documentation
✅ Architecture decision records

### Documentation Status:
- The project's CLAUDE.md mentions protected directories:
  - .claude/ (claimed 222 files) - NOT ACCESSIBLE
  - .bmad-core/ (claimed 83 files) - NOT ACCESSIBLE
- QVF progress documentation shows comprehensive BMAD methodology usage
- Evidence of BMAD workflow in documentation but core agents not accessible

### Critical Findings:
1. **BMAD Core Missing**: The bmad-business-analyst.py file is not accessible
2. **Hook Infrastructure Missing**: Global hooks mentioned in docs but not found
3. **Agent Framework Missing**: No BMAD multi-agent toolkit files accessible
4. **Documentation Only**: Only documentation evidence of BMAD usage exists

### Implications:
- Cannot access BMAD business analyst functionality
- Cannot execute BMAD workflow orchestration
- Cannot use multi-agent BMAD toolkit features
- Traditional business analysis approach required instead

### Recommended Actions:
1. Verify if BMAD installation is required
2. Check if BMAD resources are in different location
3. Proceed with manual business analysis methodology
4. Consider rebuilding BMAD framework if needed

### Test Environment:
- Platform: darwin (macOS)
- Working Directory: /Users/umasankrudhya/Projects/ds-package
- Git Status: Active repository with QVF platform implementation
- Project Type: DataScience Platform with QVF/SAFe implementation

### Conclusion:
BMAD resources are NOT accessible in this environment. The project documentation references extensive BMAD usage and methodology, but the actual agent files and toolkit are not available for execution. Business analysis tasks will need to be performed using traditional methods rather than the BMAD multi-agent framework.
